# Linkem
As a user we have diffrent links. Links like our twitter page, linkdein page, Instagram page and the rest. At a point the links get too much and 
confusing. The main goal of Linkem is to allow users add diffrent links to a page and then share the page with just one link.

# Description

  <li>The webapp allows user to add diffrent links to a form and then it renders the link in a template.</li>
  <li>Technology Used: This webapp makes use of mostly Django. Django is a high-level Python web framework with pre-written composite codes for web development, thus easing the stress of coding on the developers. It is reassuringly secure and exceedingly scalable.</li>
